    "\n",
    "# ANSWER -->\n",
    "'''If a child class is inheriting the properties of a single other class, we call it single inheritance. However,\n",
    "if a child class inherits from more than one class, i.e. this child class is derived from multiple classes, we call it multiple inheritance in Python.'''\n",

    "# ADVANTAGES:-\n",
    "\n",
    "'''1. Modular Codebase: Increases modularity, i.e., breaking down the codebase into modules, making it easier to understand. \n",
    "Here, each class we define becomes a separate module that can be inherited separately by one or many classes.'''\n",

    "'''2. Code Reusability: the child class copies all the attributes and methods of the parent class into its class and use. \n",
    "It saves time and coding effort by not rewriting them, thus following modularity paradigms.'''\n",

    "'''3. Less Development and Maintenance Costs: changes must be made in the base class, and all derived classes will automatically follow.'''\n",
